# Leveraging-Country-Statistics-to-help-understand-their-relationship-with-Global-Happiness-Project

The project aims to answer below questions
1. How do social indicators, such as urban population influence Happiness Score across countries, and how significant is their impact compared to economic and health factors?
2. How does the civil body (like access to improved drinking water and people using safely managed sanitation services) affect happiness?
3. How are suicide rates influenced by the variables included in our dataset?
